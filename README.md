# Conversational RAG with PDF Upload

This is a portfolio-worthy web application that allows users to upload a PDF document and have a real-time, streaming conversation with its content. It uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline powered by LangChain and Groq's Llama3 model.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Upload & Chat**: Users can upload any PDF and immediately start asking questions.
-   **Real-time Streaming**: The AI's response is streamed token-by-token for a dynamic, conversational feel.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, professional interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
-   **Vector-Based Retrieval**: Uses Hugging Face embeddings and a Chroma vector store to find the most relevant parts of the document to answer questions.
-   **Secure Configuration**: API keys are kept safe using a `.env` file.
